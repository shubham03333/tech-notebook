# TODO: Layout Changes for Notes App

## Tasks
- [ ] Update src/App.css to use CSS Grid for layout: define grid-template-columns for sidebar (left), editor (center), and note list (right). Make SearchBar span the top.
- [ ] Modify src/components/NoteEditor.jsx to add conditional CSS classes: when isNew or isPreview is true, apply a class that positions the editor absolutely centered on the screen.
- [ ] Ensure NoteList is styled to occupy the right column in the grid.
- [ ] Adjust src/App.jsx if needed to add wrapper divs or classes for grid areas.
- [ ] Test the app to verify centering and positioning.
- [ ] Run the app locally to check responsiveness.
